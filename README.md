# orc-invader
A clone of space invaders... with orcs or something

The idea is to learn something new. The first thing to learn is how to make a simple game in a language I'm familiar and comfortable (Python).
Then, if possible try to replicate the same game in Rust.

The assets are not going to be commited to the repository until I'm completely sure about their licence.
